# C++ Sorting Algorithms API

An API in C++ with a variety of the most popular sorting algorithms ranging from linear to quadratic complexity. Works with native C and C++ dynamic and static arrays

# Algorithms

1) Counting sort

2) Merge sort

3) Quicksort

4) Heapsort

5) Insertion sort

6) Bubble sort

7) Min sort

# Usage and Limitations

Current implementation only supports native C++ static and dynamic arrays. No extra dependencies. Simply download the header file, include it in the project's directory and use it.
